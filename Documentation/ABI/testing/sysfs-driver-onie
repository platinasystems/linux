Description:
	These files provide an interface for the respective TLV of an
	ONIE format NVMEM device or cell:
 
	    country_code    mac_base*         part_number    vendor
	    crc*            manufacture_date  platform_name  vendor_extension*
	    device_version* manufacturer      product_name
	    diag_version    num_macs*         serial_number
	    label_revision  onie_version      service_tag
 
	See,
	<https://opencomputeproject.github.io/onie/design-spec/hw_requirements.html>

	Each file has formatted text values of the respective type.  With
	except those marked, this is simple text with the trailing newline
	trimmed on write.

	    mac_base
		A network link address in 00:01:02:03:04:05 format.

	    num_macs
		A decimal, unsigned integer representing the be16_to_cpu() value.

	    device_version
		A decimal, unsigned integer representing the 1-byte value.
 
	    vendor_extension
		A binary concatenated contents of all such TLVs.
 
	    crc
		A hexadecimal, unsigned integer in 0x%08x format representing
		the be32_to_cpu() value.  A write to any other file only
		updates the cached value. Any crc write results in
		recalculation of the trailing CRC followed by an NVMEM	update.

	A file read of a missing respective NVMEM TLV results in ENOMSG.  With
	an unformatted NVMEM, all files return ENOMSG.

	The ONIE platform device may be instantiated by the device tree or
	ACPI. It may also be created by the driver if through its "nvmem"
	module parameter. A period (".") results in the driver by-passing NVMEM
	load to use the initially empty cache. Any other non-empty value
	results in the driver attempting to load the named NVMEM device.
	Otherwise, the empty "nvmem" parameter results in the attempted load of
	the NVMEM cell named "onie-data" created by through device-tree or ACPI
	configuration.

	The driver also provides these files for NVMEM diagnostics.

	    nvmem_name
		Name of the loaded cell or device. A write results in load
		of the named device and subsequent write-back triggered through
		any write of the "crc" file.

	    nvmem_cache
		A read-only, binary view of the current data.
