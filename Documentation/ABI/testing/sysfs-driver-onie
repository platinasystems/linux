Description:
	The onie platform driver is an NVMEM consumer that provides these
	interface files for the respective TLVs of an ONIE format NVMEM device
	or cell:
 
	    country_code    mac_base*         part_number    vendor
	    crc*            manufacture_date  platform_name  vendor_extension*
	    device_version* manufacturer      product_name
	    diag_version    num_macs*         serial_number
	    label_revision  onie_version      service_tag
 
	See,
	<https://opencomputeproject.github.io/onie/design-spec/hw_requirements.html>

	Each file has formatted text values of the respective type.  With
	except those marked, this is simple text with the trailing newline
	trimmed on write.

	    mac_base
		A network link address in 00:01:02:03:04:05 format.

	    num_macs
		A decimal, unsigned integer representing the be16_to_cpu().

	    device_version
		A decimal, unsigned integer representing the 1-byte value.
 
	    vendor_extension
		A binary concatenation of all such TLVs.
 
	    crc
		A hexadecimal, unsigned integer in 0x%08x format representing
		the be32_to_cpu() value.  A write to any other file only
		updates the cached data but anything writen to crc results in
		recalculation of the trailing CRC followed by NVMEM update.

	A file read of a missing respective NVMEM TLV results in ENOMSG.  With
	an unformatted NVMEM, all files return ENOMSG.

	The ONIE platform device must be instantiated by the device tree or
	ACPI. If such device is unavailable, the platform driver only provides
	access to the initially blank cache. By default, the driver associates
	with the nvmem cell named "onie-data". This may be overriden with the
	"nvmem" module parameter.  A period (".") parameter results in the
	driver by-passing NVMEM load. A "cell:CELL" prefaced parameter results
	in the driver loading the trailling CELL instead of the default,
	"onie-data". Anything else results in the driver loading the named
	NVMEM device.

	The driver also provides these files for NVMEM diagnostics.

	    nvmem
		The read-only name of the loaded cell or device.

	    cache
		A binary view of the cached data. A write updates the cache but
		the above files will all return -ENOMSG unless the contents are
		a valid ONIE format with a correct crc.
